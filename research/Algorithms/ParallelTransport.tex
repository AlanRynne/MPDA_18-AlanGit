\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE A surface $\Phi$, represented as a triangular mesh (V,E,F)
\ENSURE Set of geodesic curves $g_i,\quad where \quad i=0,...,M$
\STATE Place a geodesic curve $g_x$ along $S$ such that it divides the surface completely in 2.
\STATE Divide the curve into $N$ equally spaced points $p$ with distance $W$.
\STATE Place an vector $\mathbf v$  onto $p_0$
\STATE Parallel transport that vector along $g_x$ as described in [@fig:parTransProc].
\FORALL {points $p_i$ where i = 0,...,M}
  \STATE Generate geodesic curve $+g_i$ and $-g_i$ using vector $\mathbf{v}_i$ and $\mathbf{-v}_i$ respectively.
  \STATE Join $+g_i$ and $-g_i$ together to obtain $g_i$
  \STATE Add $g_i$ to output.
