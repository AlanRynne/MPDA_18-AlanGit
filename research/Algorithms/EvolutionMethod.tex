\REQUIRE {A surface $\Phi$, represented as a triangular mesh (V,E,F), a specified distance $W$, a threshold $\epsilon$ and a maximum number of iterations.}
\ENSURE Set $g$ of geodesic curves of approximate equal distance, $g_i,\quad where \quad i=0,...,M$
\STATE Place a geodesic curve $g_0$ along $S$ such that it traverses across the whole surface.
\FOR {$m=1$} \TO {$m<MAX_ITER$}
    \STATE Divide $g_{m-1}$ into $N$ equally spaced points $p$ with distance $W$.
    \FORALL {points $p_i$ where i = 0,...,M}
        \STATE Rotate the direction $\mathbf{v}_i$ of curve $g_{m-1}$ at point $p_i$ by $0.5\pi$
        \STATE Obtain perp geodesic $H^T_i$ using $\mathbf{v}_i$ and $p_i$.
        \STATE Obtain parameter $t^T_i$ of a point at $W$ distance from the curve's start point $p_i$.
        \STATE Add $H^T_i$ to list of $H^T$'s.
        \STATE Add $t^T_i$ to list of $t^T$'s.
    \ENDFOR
    \STATE Select a starting index $j$.
    \STATE Find $g_m$, the best fit geodesic of $g_m-1$ from $t^T_j$ using the list of $H^T$'s and $t^T$'s [see #alg:bestFitGeodesic]
    \IF {$g_m != null$}
        \STATE Add $g_m$ to $G$.
    \ELSE {BREAK LOOP}
    \ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\RETURN The geodesic pattern $G$ of all $g_i$'s.
