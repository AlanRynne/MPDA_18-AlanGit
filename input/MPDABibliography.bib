               introduces the differential geometry of curves and surfaces in
               both local and global aspects. The presentation departs from the
               traditional approach with its more extensive use of elementary
               linear algebra and its emphasis on basic geometrical facts
               rather than machinery or random details. Many examples and
               exercises enhance the clear, well-written exposition, along with
               hints and answers to some of the problems. The treatment begins
               with a chapter on curves, followed by explorations of regular
               surfaces, the geometry of the Gauss map, the intrinsic geometry
               of surfaces, and global differential geometry. Suitable for
               advanced undergraduates and graduate students of mathematics,
               this text's prerequisites include an undergraduate course in
               linear algebra and some familiarity with the calculus of several
               variables. For this second edition, the author has corrected,
               revised, and updated the entire volume.",

  title = {Geodesic Lines on Free-Form Surfaces - Optimized Grids for Timber Rib Shells},
  author = {Weinand, Yves and Pirazzi, Claudio},
  journal = {World Conference in Timber Engineering WCTE},
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {In addition to glue-laminated timber, screw-laminated   timber has increasingly been applied to rib shells. The   ribs are made from laminated timber boards, which are   joined together with the aid of pin-like fasteners such as   screws or nails. The current research is meant to optimize   these grids on free-form surfaces with regard to the   bending stress due to initial curvature of the boards.   This can be done by arranging the ribs according to   geodesic lines which allows the application of straight   boards, subjected only to bending about their week axis   and to torsion. The determination of such geodesic grids   on free-form surfaces, currently enjoying great popularity   in contemporary architecture, is quite complex. In order   to satisfy this demand and to improve automation of the   production process, the software GEOS has been developed   in close collaboration with the Laboratory of Timber   Construction (EPFL/IBOIS) and the chair of Geometry   (EPFL/GEOM). This software calculates grids of geodesic   lines on free-form surfaces and provides all geometrical   data necessary for computer-controlled sawing. Free-form   surfaces are treated as BÃ©zier surfaces. In order to   proved the reliability of the assumptions the program is   based upon, a timber rib shell prototype   (length/width/height: 8000 mm x 3000 mm x 2060 mm) was   build. Thin timber laths (12/60 mm) were used. All laths   were sawn and predrilled by means of computer-controlled   sawing. The prototype could thus be built in relatively   short time. In general, it can be stated that even after   assembly of the fourth layer the predrilled holes at the   intersections fitted precisely about 85% of the time. This   confirms the reliability of the calculation and shows that   the demanded precision is kept even for significant   curvatures. For a better understanding of the load-bearing   behavior of the structure load tests were carried out. The   comparison of the measured deformations with the   calculated deformations enabled us to evaluate the   calculation model, based on a framed load-bearing system.   For small charges, good accordance between calculation and   reality could be noticed. The software GEOS provides an   important tool for the design and the realization of   timber rib shells. It contributes to clarifying current   uncertainties in the design planning process and will   highly improve the confidence of engineers and architects   in conceiving and realizing this type of challenging   lightweight spatial structures.},

We conclude the paper with an analysis of stress and strain in bent and twisted panels.",

Self-detailing and selfdocumenting systems are here understood as the use of parametric tools to capture and reuse design and fabrication know-how. This approach seeks not to supplant the designer or fabricator's skills, but to create a shared platform for material innovation open to all the participants in the design team. By treating the production and detailing of this case study project as a system instead of a discreet design object, the authors also seek to illustrate the changing role of computational design tools and the implications for the practices of detail design and fabrication.",
