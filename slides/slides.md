# Objective

---

Discretize a given freeform surface into panels with the following properties:

1. Panels must be ***developable*** [@shelden2002digital]

2. Panels should be of approximate ***equal width***  

3. Panels should be ***as straight as possible***

4. Panels should ***bend by their weak axis*** to approximate the surface.

# Background

---

The use of *straight developable planks* is widely used in:

![Traditional boat building](http://woodboatbuilder.com/maid-planking/sm13planks.jpg){width=60%}

---

Also common practice in naval engineering industry:

![Connected developable patches for boat hull design](https://github.com/AlanRynne/MPDA_18-MasterThesis/raw/master/slides/slideImages/developableHull.jpeg){width=70%}

## Frank Ghery

This techniques have also been used in the architecture world, mainly by **Frank Ghery**.

His faÃ§ades are usually a collection of connected developable surfaces.

---

Latest architectural work following this techniques was:

It was designed as a collection of:

* **Developable surfaces**
  * *Which can be covered by equal width planks*  
* **Surfaces of constant curvature**  
  * *Which can be covered by repeating the same profile*

# Construction technique

## Geodesic curves

A geodesic curve is the generalization of a *straight line* into *curved spaces*.

In this research, we concentrate on the concept of ***straightest geodesics***.

![Straightest geodesic on a torus](resources/images/svg/ShortestGeodesics.png){#fig:straightestGeodesic size=90%}

## Developable surfaces

![Surfaces with ***0 gaussian curvature***. Meaning, they can be flattened onto a plane ***without distortion***](resources/images/svg/DevelopableFromCurve.png){#fig:devFromCurve}

---

Developable surfaces
: \
  
  * surfaces that can be flattened.
  * can be generated by a single curve.  

Geodesic curves
: \
  
  * are straight lines in a curved space.

---

If
: Panels are generated using geodesic curves on the surface

Then
: Resulting panels will be ***developable*** and mostly ***straight*** when flat.

---

In other words
: \
  
  We wish to cover a given freeform surface with a pattern of **geodesic curves** with equal spacing.

This can only be achieved if the provided surface is already *developable*.\
\
A compromise exists between the *curve spacing* and the *curves geodesic property*

# Algorithmic strategies

## Obtaining Geodesic Patterns

These are the main methods for the obtaining successful geodesic patterns:

1. The ***parallel transport*** method
2. The ***evolution*** method
    1. The ***piecewise geodesic*** evolution method
3. The ***level-set*** method

# The parallel transport method

## Vector parallel transport

![Parallel transport of a vector over a path on a sphere](resources/images/svg/SpherePT.png){#fig:ptSphere}

---

![Parallel transport over two adjacent mesh faces](resources/images/svg/Diagram-ParallelTransport.png){#fig:ptDiagram}

## P.T. Implementation

\small
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE {A surface $\Phi$, represented as a triangular mesh (V,E,F), a specified distance $W$, a threshold $\epsilon$ and a maximum number of iterations.}
\ENSURE Set $g$ of geodesic curves of approximate equal distance, $g_i,\quad where \quad i=0,...,M$
\STATE Place a geodesic curve $g_0$ along $S$ such that it traverses across the whole surface.
\RETURN The geodesic pattern $G$ of all $g_i$'s.
\end{algorithmic}

---

There are **three** *extreme* cases depending on the ***local gaussian curvature*** where $g$ lies on $\Phi$:

Positive curvature
: Panels will have **Maximum width** on $g$

Negative curvature
: Panels will have **Minimum width** on $g$

0 gaussian curvature:
: Panels will be  of equal width

## P.T. Example

## P.T. Results

# The Evolution Method

![Calculating the best-fit geodesic](resources/images/svg/Diagram-BestFitGeodesic.png){#fig:bestFitGeodesic}

## Evolution Implementation

\small
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE A surface $\Phi$, represented as a triangular mesh (V,E,F)
\ENSURE Set of geodesic curves $g_i,\quad where \quad i=0,...,M$
\STATE Place a geodesic curve $g_x$ along $S$ such that it divides the surface completely in 2.
\STATE Divide the curve into $N$ equally spaced points $p$ with distance $W$.
\STATE Place an vector $\mathbf v$  onto $p_0$
\STATE Parallel transport that vector along $g_x$ as described in [@fig:parTransProc].
\FORALL {points $p_i$ where i = 0,...,M}
\STATE Generate geodesic curve $+g_i$ and $-g_i$ using vector $\mathbf{v}_i$ and $\mathbf{-v}_i$ respectively.
\STATE Join $+g_i$ and $-g_i$ together to obtain $g_i$
\STATE Add $g_i$ to output.
\ENDFOR
