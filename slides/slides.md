## Objective

--

Discretize a given freeform surface into panels with the following properties:

1.  Panels must be ***developable***

2. Panels should be of approximate ***equal width***

3. Panels should be ***as straight as possible***

4. Panels should ***bend by their weak axis*** to aproximate the surface.

Note:
This will only display in the notes window.

## Background

--

The use of *sraight developable planks* is widely used in **traditional boat building**

--

Connected developable patches for boat hull design.

* Common practice in naval engineering industry.

Note:
Need better image for this!

This techniques have also been used in the architecture world, mainly by **Frank Ghery**.

His façades are usually a collection of connected developable surfaces.

Latest architectural work following this techiques was:

Burj Khalifa interior cladding

--

It was designed as a collection of:

* **Developable surfaces**
  * *Which can be covered by equal width planks*
* **Surfaces of constant cuvrature**
  * *Which can be covered by repeating the same profile*

### What is a geodesic curve?

A geodesic curve is the generalization of a *straight line* into *curved spaces*.

***Which means...***



--

It could be easiy understood as:

*The path that a bug follows on a surface if it only moves **forward***

### What are they?

***Geodesic patterns*** are .......

### Geodesic Pattern benefits
—————
* Mostly straight rectangular panels
* Bending only by their weak axis

## Obtaining Geodesic Patterns

There are three main methods for the obtaining succesfful geodesic patterns:
1. The parallel transport method

2. The evolution method

3. The piecewise geodesic vector-field method
