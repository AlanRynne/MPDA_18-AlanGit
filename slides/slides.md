# Objective

---

Discretize a given freeform surface into panels with the following properties:

1. Panels must be ***developable*** [@shelden2002digital]

2. Panels should be of approximate ***equal width***  

3. Panels should be ***as straight as possible***

4. Panels should ***bend by their weak axis*** to approximate the surface.

# Background

---

The use of *straight developable planks* is widely used in:

---

Also common practice in naval engineering industry:

## Frank Ghery

This techniques have also been used in the architecture world, mainly by **Frank Ghery**.

His faÃ§ades are usually a collection of connected developable surfaces.

---

Latest architectural work following this techniques was:

It was designed as a collection of:

* **Developable surfaces**  
  * *Which can be covered by equal width planks*  
* **Surfaces of constant curvature**  
  * *Which can be covered by repeating the same profile*

# Construction technique

## Geodesic curves

A geodesic curve is the generalization of a *straight line* into *curved spaces*.

## Straightest geodesics

In this research, we concentrate on the concept of ***straightest geodesics***.

## Developable surfaces

![Surfaces with ***0 gaussian curvature***. Meaning, they can be flattened onto a plane ***without distortion***](resources/images/svg/DevelopableFromCurve.svg){#fig:devFromCurve}

---

Developable surfaces
: \
  
  * surfaces that can be flattened.
  * can be generated by a single curve.  

Geodesic curves
: \
  
  * are straight lines in a curved space.

---

If
: Panels are generated using geodesic curves on the surface

Then
: Resulting panels will be ***developable*** and mostly ***straight*** when flat.

---

In other words
: \
  
  We wish to cover a given freeform surface with a pattern of **geodesic curves** with equal spacing.

This can only be achieved if the provided surface is already *developable*.\
\
A compromise exists between the *curve spacing* and the *curves geodesic property*

# Algorithmic strategies

## Obtaining Geodesic Patterns

These are the main methods for the obtaining successful geodesic patterns:

1. The ***parallel transport*** method
2. The ***evolution*** method
    1. The ***piecewise geodesic*** evolution method
3. The ***level-set*** method

# The parallel transport method

## Vector parallel transport

![Parallel transport of a vector over a path on a sphere](resources/images/svg/SpherePT.svg){#fig:ptSphere}

## P.T. Example
