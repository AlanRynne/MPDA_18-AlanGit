# Objective

## Objective

Discretize a given freeform surface into panels with the following properties:

1.  Panels must be ***developable***

2. Panels should be of approximate ***equal width***

3. Panels should be ***as straight as possible***

4. Panels should ***bend by their weak axis*** to aproximate the surface.

# Background

## Boat-building

The use of *sraight developable planks* is widely used in **traditional boat building**

## Developable hulls

Connected developable patches for boat hull design.

* Common practice in naval engineering industry.

## Frank Ghery

This techniques have also been used in the architecture world, mainly by **Frank Ghery**.

His fa√ßades are usually a collection of connected developable surfaces.

## Burj Khalifa

Latest architectural work following this techiques was:

## Burj Khalifa

It was designed as a collection of:

* **Developable surfaces**
  * *Which can be covered by equal width planks*
* **Surfaces of constant cuvrature**
  * *Which can be covered by repeating the same profile*

# Construction technique

## Geodesic curves

A geodesic curve is the generalization of a *straight line* into *curved spaces*.

## Geodesic curves

It could be easiy understood as:

*The path that a bug follows on a surface if it only moves **forward***

## Straightest geodesics

In this research, we concentrate on the concept of ***straightest geodesics***.

## Developable surfaces

Surfaces with ***0 gaussian curvature***. Meaning, they can be flattened onto a plane ***without distorsion***

![A developable surface can be generated using by sweeping a line along a given curve.](https://github.com/AlanRynne/MPDA_18-MasterThesis/raw/master/resources/images/svg/DevelopableFromCurve.png){width=50%}

## Developable surfaces

>Developable surfaces:
> 
> * can be flattened
> * can be generated by a single curve.

***and***

> Geodesic curves:
> 
> * are straight lines in a curved space.

## Therefore

> We wish to generate panels using geodesic curves in order to achieve ***straight developable panels***

## Developable surfaces

In other words:

> We wish to cover a given freeform surface with a pattern of **geodesic curves** with equal spacing.

This can only be achieved if the provided surface is already *developable*.

> A compromise exists between the *curve spacing* and the *curve geodesic property*

# Algorithmic strategies

## Obtaining Geodesic Patterns

There are three main methods for the obtaining succesfful geodesic patterns:

1. The parallel transport method

2. The evolution method

3. The piecewise geodesic vector-field method


# The parallel transport method

## Vector parallel transport
