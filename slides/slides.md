# Objective

---

Discretize a given freeform surface into planks with the following properties:

1. Must be ***developable*** [@shelden2002digital]

2. Should tend to have approximate ***equal width***  

3. Should be ***as straight as possible***

4. Cannot bend by their strong axis but,
   
5. can have a twist and bend by their weak axis

---

Plank
: A plank is timber that is flat, elongated, and rectangular with parallel faces that are higher and longer than wide. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plank_(wood)))

# Background

---

The use of *straight developable planks* is widely used in:

![Traditional boat building](http://woodboatbuilder.com/maid-planking/sm13planks.jpg){width=60%}

---

Also common practice in naval engineering industry:

NOX was one of the first to experiment with paper strips.

## Frank Ghery

This techniques have also been used in the architecture world, mainly by **Frank Ghery**.

His faÃ§ades are usually a collection of connected developable surfaces.

---

Latest architectural work following this techniques was:

It was designed as a collection of:

* **Developable surfaces**
  * *Which can be covered by equal width planks*  
* **Surfaces of constant curvature**  
  * *Which can be covered by repeating the same profile*

# Construction technique

## Geodesic curves

A geodesic curve is the generalization of a *straight line* into *curved spaces*.

In this research, we concentrate on the concept of ***straightest geodesics***.

## Developable surfaces

If
: Panels are generated using geodesic curves on the surface

Then
: Resulting panels will be ***developable*** and mostly ***straight*** when flat.

![A straight plank laying on a hyperbolic paraboloid](resources/images/vector/HyparPlanks.svg){#fig:hyparPlank width=40%}

In other words
: \
  
  We wish to cover a given freeform surface with a pattern of **geodesic curves** with equal spacing.

  This can only be achieved if the provided surface is already *developable*.\
  \
  A compromise exists between the *curve spacing* and the *curve's geodesic curvature*

# Algorithmic strategies

## Obtaining Geodesic Patterns

These are the main methods for the obtaining successful geodesic patterns:

1. The ***parallel transport*** method
2. The ***evolution*** method
    1. The ***piecewise geodesic*** evolution method
3. The ***level-set*** method

# The parallel transport method

## Vector parallel transport

## P.T. Implementation

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE A surface $\Phi$, represented as a triangular mesh (V,E,F)
\ENSURE Set of geodesic curves $g_i,\quad where \quad i=0,...,M$
\STATE Place a geodesic curve $g_x$ along $S$ such that it divides the surface completely in 2.
\STATE Divide the curve into $N$ equally spaced points $p$ with distance $W$.
\STATE Place an vector $\mathbf v$  onto $p_0$
\STATE Parallel transport that vector along $g_x$ as described in [@fig:parTransProc].
\FORALL {points $p_i$ where i = 0,...,M}
  \STATE Generate geodesic curve $+g_i$ and $-g_i$ using vector $\mathbf{v}_i$ and $\mathbf{-v}_i$ respectively.
  \STATE Join $+g_i$ and $-g_i$ together to obtain $g_i$
  \STATE Add $g_i$ to output.
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}

There are **three** *extreme* cases depending on the ***local gaussian curvature*** where $g$ lies on $\Phi$:

Positive curvature
: Panels will have **Maximum width** on $g$

Negative curvature
: Panels will have **Minimum width** on $g$

0 gaussian curvature:
: Panels will be  of equal width

### Tangent-developable method

---

:::::::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
Given any point in $g$:

1. Assuming $T(x)$ is tangent $g$.  
2. Compute $U(x)$ as $T(x)\times N_\Phi(x)$

> The union of all $U(x)$ is a developable ruled surface $\Psi$.
:::
:::{.column width=50%}
![Tangent developable method for panels](resources/images/vector/Panels-TangentDevelopable.svg){#fig:tangDevPanels}
:::
:::::::::


---

Initial algorithm is as follows:

> For all geodesics $s_i$ in a given pattern:

1. Compute the *tangent developable surfaces* $\rightarrow\Psi_i$
2. Trim $\Psi_i$ along the intersection curves with their respective neighbours.
3. Unfold the trimmed $\Psi_i$, obtaining the panels in flat state.

***Unfortunately***, this method needs to be refined in order to work in practice because:

1. The rulings of tangent developable may behave in weird ways
2. The intersection of the neighboring $\Psi_i$'s is often *ill-defined*.

---

Therefore, the procedure was modified in the following way:

1. Compute the *tangent developable surfaces* $\Psi_i$ for all surfaces $s_i \rightarrow i=\text{even numbers}$
2. Delete all rulings where the angle enclose with the tangent $\alpha$ is smaller than a certain threshold (i.e. 20Âº).
3. Fill the holes in the rulings by interpolation (???)
4. On each ruling:
  1. Determine points $A_i(x)$ and $B_i(x)$ which are the closest to geodesics $s_{i-1}$ and $s_{i+1}$. This serves for trimming the surface $\Psi_i$.
5. Optimize globally the positions of points $A_i(x)$ and $B_i(x)$ such that
  1. Trim curves are *smooth*
  2. $A_i(x)$ and $B_i(x)$ are close to geodesics $s_{i-1}$ and $s_{i+1}$
  3. The ruling segments $A_i(x)B_i(x)$ lies close to the *original surface* $\Phi$

The objective is to divide or *cut* the mesh into areas that will be easilly covered by a 1-pattern of geodesics [^PottmanPatterns].

## Developability of triangle meshes


[^KraneDevelop]: Image taken from @Stein2018DSF

Different methods for *developalizing* meshes have been developed over the years:

Energy applied is equivalent to forcing all vertices *angle defect* to be 0.

![Any given vertex on a mesh (left) will become either flat (centre) or a hinge (right)[^KraneDevelop]](resources/images/developability/developability-figure-12.png){#fig:developableSpheres2}

This will automatically create *hinges* in the vertices where it is not possible to be flat.

# Analysis

## Gaps in panelization

> ???

## Stress in panels

> **Assuming the material:**

* is bent to the shape of a ruled surface $\Psi$
* the central line $m$ of the plank follows the *'middle geodesic'* in $\Psi$.\
\

> **Then:**

* Lines parallel to $m$ at distance $d/2$ are not only bent but also stretched.

---

If we introduce the radius of Gaussian curvature $\rho = 1 / \sqrt{|K|}$

the relative increment in length $\varepsilon$ (strain) of the strip is:

$$\varepsilon=\frac{1}{2}(d/2\rho)^2+\cdots $$ {#eq:strain}

where $d$ is the planks width.

---

### Tensile stress

Tensile stress can be expressed as $\sigma = E\varepsilon$[^safety], which yields:

$$ d/2\rho\leq C,\quad{with}\quad{C=\sqrt{\sigma _{max}/E}}$$

$$\sigma_{max} = \text{maximum admissible stress}$$
$$E = \text {Young's modulus}$$ 

[^safety]: Since this calculation is an approximation, a safety factor must be used when choosing $\sigma_{max}$.

---

$$ d/2\rho\leq C,\quad{with}\quad{C=\sqrt{\sigma _{max}/E}}$$

Since $C$ is a material constant. We obtain the maximum admissible width with:

$$d_{max} = 2\rho_{min}C$$

---

| Steel | 13000  |   |   |
| Others? | ? | | |
: Example calculation of constant $C$ for some of the most suitable materials.

## Bending and shear stress

> **Only for panels with thin rectangular cross-sections ($h/d \ll 1$)**

Bending ($\sigma$) and shear stresses ($\tau$) depend on:

Panel thickness $h$ but ***not*** on the panel width $d$.

---

Maximum values occur on the outer surface of the panel [@Wallner2010tiling] and depend on:

* the curvature $\kappa$ of the central geodesic
* the rate of torsion $\theta$  of the panel.

> $$\sigma = E \kappa h/2 \quad and\quad \tau = hG\theta$${#eq:bendingAndShear}

Where $G$ is the shear modulus.

---

$\tau$, measured by arc per meter, does not exceed $\sqrt{|K|} = 1/\rho$, 

maximum value ocurs if:

* the central geodesic's tangent is an asymptotic direction of the panel surface [@DoCarmo2016kx].

---

It is standard procedure to combine all streses (tension, shear, bending) and use this information for checking panel admissibility.
